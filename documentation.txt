Webspeech is a speech recognition system for chrome 26 or higher.
It works on both http as well as https. http requires permission for accessing microphone every time while https requires only once.
In my module user can:-
	1)Search google, youtube ,bing using voice.
	2)Type Emails, letters using voice.
	3)Dictionary module is still under construction.
	4)English to hindi text tranlation using voice.
	5)Text to speech
	6)A live tile to display weather and time. 
 
I will be making this as a chrome start page in future.
